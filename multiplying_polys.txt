;;defining a function called get-c, to get the first term in a list
(defun get-c (term)
              (car term))


;;defining a function called get-p, to get the second term in  a list
(defun get-p (term)
                  (car (cdr term)))

;;1,defining a function called poly to multiply two polynomials
(defun add_poly (p1 p2)		;;function poly receives two polynomials
(let ((t1 (car p1))(t2 (car p2)))	;;setting t1 and t2 to the first terms of the ;;corresponding polynomial
                (if (or (null t1)(null t2)) nil		;;making sure that the terms are not empty
                  (if( eql (get-p t1)(get-p t2))	;;checking if the terms of the two polynomial have
 ;;the same degree
		;;putting together the resulting polynomial:
                     (append(list (list( +(get-c t1)(get-c t2))(get-p t1)))(add_poly(cdr p1)(cdr p2)))))))






;; 2,defining a function to multiply a polynomial by a constant
(defun fun (poly a)		;;fun excepts a polynomial and a number
              (let ((term (car poly)))	;;setting  term to the first term in the polynomial
                (if (null term) nil	;;checking if the term is not empty
	;;putting together the resulting polynomial:
                (append (list (list (*(get-c term) a) (get-p term))) (fun(cdr poly)a)))))
